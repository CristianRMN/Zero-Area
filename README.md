Welcome to my first godot project. The name of the game is "Area Zero". The game will be in 2D and the goal is to make 100 levels,
bosses every 10 levels and the respective final boss.
It is an ambitious project in which I am going to go little by little.
I will comment on all the steps I am doing. It should be said that I have never used godot except for a course in which I was taught the basics, which I am applying and expanding my knowledge.

Getting started:
**Character creation**.

We've created our main character, which is going to be a turtle. It will be called Galapagos, which, as we advance in the game, will be stronger and will learn new skills.

**First advances in movements**.

This is the script to make the character move sideways and jump. With the spritesFrames we have managed to get it to acquire that kind of movement when walking from one side to the other.
